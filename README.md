# It's a matter of semantics

**Instructions**: 
* Look at the mock-up image below - determine which elements are being used on the page. 
* Create a very simple page using **semantic elements**. The page should offer some basic information about a topic that you're interested in. 
* The page should link to additional resources on the topic on the web.
* Add basic styling to the page using CSS e.g. colors, borders, text-align, etc. (use Google to find out more about properties you don't know)
